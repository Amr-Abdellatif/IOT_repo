# IOT Home Automation using Blynk and a 2-Relay Module
## This project demonstrates how to use the Blynk app to control a 220VAC bulb through a 2-relay module connected to a home WiFi network.

## Hardware Components

1- ESP8266 NodeMCU

2-Relay Module

3-220VAC Bulb

4-Jumper wires

5-Software Components

6-Blynk app (iOS or Android)

7-Arduino IDE

8-Blynk library for Arduino

## Setup Instructions

1.	Connect the ESP8266 NodeMCU to the 2-relay module and the 220VAC bulb according to the circuit diagram provided.
2.	Download and install the Blynk app on your smartphone.
3.	Create a new project in the Blynk app and generate a unique authentication token.
4.	Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
5.	Install the Blynk library for Arduino using the library manager in the Arduino IDE.
6.	Open the provided Arduino sketch in the IDE and enter your WiFi credentials and the unique Blynk authentication token.
7.	Upload the sketch to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
8.	Add a button widget in the Blynk app and connect it to virtual pin V0.
9.	Power on the ESP8266 NodeMCU and the bulb should now be controllable through the Blynk app.


## Usage
Press the button in the Blynk app to turn the bulb on or off.

## Notes
Make sure to properly connect the relay module to the 220VAC bulb and use caution when handling high voltage electrical equipment.
This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes and not recommended for use in a commercial or critical environment.


This project was created by me as a demonstration of IoT home automation using the Blynk app and a 2-relay module. Feel free to customize and improve upon the code and circuit provided.
